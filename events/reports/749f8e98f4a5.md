# Mountaineering Incident Report

## Executive Summary
- On May 10, 2025, a four-person alpine climbing team retreated from Early Winter Couloir between the Early Winters Spires (Washington Pass) as a storm moved in. During the descent, a weathered fixed piton used as a rappel anchor reportedly failed.
- All four climbers fell approximately 400 feet in total; three were killed and one survived with injuries. The survivor self-evacuated and notified authorities; the deceased were recovered by helicopter.

## Location and Context
- Peak/Area: Early Winters Spires (between North and South Early Winters Spires; North Early Winters Spire area)
- Region: Washington, Cascades (Washington Pass, Liberty Bell Group)
- Activity/Style: Alpine climbing; route: Early Winter Couloir (AI3 M4+); descent/rappel during retreat
- Context: Storm moving in during afternoon/evening with light snow; poor visibility/darkness after the fall; late-day retreat (~5:30 p.m.)

## Timeline of Events
| Time (approx.) | Event |
|---|---|
| Saturday afternoon/evening | Weather deteriorated (storm/light snow). |
| ~5:30 p.m. | Team decided to retreat from Early Winter Couloir. |
| Evening | During a rappel/descent, a weathered fixed piton anchor reportedly failed; all four fell. |
| ~10:00 p.m. | Survivor reported regaining awareness after the fall. |
| Night | Survivor extricated himself and hiked over rock/snow to the trailhead in darkness. |
| Late night | Survivor drove west and called 911 from a payphone in Newhalem. |
| Subsequent operations | Deceased climbers recovered by helicopter; survivor hospitalized at Harborview Medical Center. |

## Technical and Environmental Factors
- Anchor System:
  - Fixed piton described as weathered/old-looking.
  - Reported failure mode: piton ripped from the rock.
  - Rope observed attached to a single weathered piton after the incident.
  - Presence of a backup anchor: unknown.
- Group Exposure:
  - Roped for descent; all four attached to the same rope.
  - Number of people on rope at time of failure: 4 (reported).
- Terrain:
  - Initial near-vertical terrain (~200 ft) followed by a rocky, partially snow-covered chute (~200 ft).
  - Total fall estimate: ~122 m (~400 ft) in two components (~61 m + ~61 m).
- Environmental Conditions:
  - Storm arriving with light snow.
  - Poor visibility and darkness after the fall.
  - Late in the day.

## Causal Analysis
### Proximate Cause
- Rappel anchor failure involving a single, weathered fixed piton (reported).

### Failure Modes
- Reported piton pullout from rock; exact mechanical mode not verified.

### Contributing Factors
- Technical:
  - Reliance on a single, weathered fixed piton as the primary rappel anchor (backup unknown).
  - All four climbers attached to one rope, increasing potential load on the anchor.
- Environmental:
  - Deteriorating weather (storm/light snow).
  - Darkness/poor visibility and late hour.
- Human (Individual):
  - Not enough information on individual decisions or experience to assess.
- Human (Team):
  - Late-day retreat; group exposure to a single anchor during descent.

### Decision Review
The team chose to retreat as a storm moved in late in the day, a prudent decision given deteriorating weather. During descent, the party relied on a weathered fixed piton as the rappel anchor; no confirmed backup was documented. With all four attached to the same rope, any anchor failure was likely to have group-wide consequences.

The reported piton failure precipitated a long fall and slide, leading to multiple fatalities and one injured survivor. Darkness, poor visibility, and late hour complicated post-incident self-evacuation and delayed notification to authorities.

## Counterfactual Scenarios (Preventability)
| Topic | Original State | Alternative | Avoidability | Expected Effect | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Anchor redundancy | Single weathered fixed piton used; backup unknown | Build and equalize a redundant, multi-point anchor (e.g., back up fixed piton with removable protection) | Possibly feasible given presence of removable protection; time/rock quality unknown | Reduced likelihood of catastrophic anchor failure | Medium |
| Group loading on rappel | All four attached to the same rope | One-at-a-time rappel with independent attachment; keep only one person weighting the anchor | Generally feasible standard practice | Lower peak/dynamic load on anchor; reduced group consequence of failure | Medium |
| Timing vs. weather/light | Retreat initiated late in day with storm arriving | Retreat earlier to maintain daylight and visibility | Unclear feasibility; dependent on earlier weather/timing decisions | Improved anchor assessment and communication; potentially safer descent windows | Low–Medium |
| Communication from field | GPS communication device carried but not used initially | Use device to contact 911/SAR from the field if possible | Feasible if device functioning and connectivity available | Earlier notification and targeted response; unclear effect on survivability | Low |

## Uncertainties and Gaps
- Whether backup anchors existed or were employed.
- Exact mechanical cause of the piton failure (reported pullout; no forensic confirmation).
- Precise chronological sequence and timestamps for the fall, self-evacuation, emergency call, and rescue/recovery.
- Detailed rope/anchor configuration (spacing, loading sequence) and dynamic loads during the event.
- No official coroner/SAR after-action or final investigation report available.
- Potential discrepancies among media summaries; current attributions are preliminary.

## Rescue and Outcome
- The survivor self-evacuated in darkness, reached a vehicle, drove west, and called 911 from a payphone in Newhalem. He was later hospitalized at Harborview Medical Center.
- Reported impediments included darkness, disorientation/head trauma, late hour, and light snow.
- Agencies involved included the Okanogan County Sheriff's Office and medical partners (UW Medicine/Harborview). The Snohomish County Helicopter Rescue Team recovered the deceased by helicopter.

## Lessons Learned
- Treat fixed pitons—especially weathered ones—as suspect; back them up with modern protection and build redundant, equalized rappel anchors when possible.
- Limit group exposure on descent: rappel one at a time and avoid having multiple climbers simultaneously weighted on a single anchor.
- Anticipate deteriorating weather and dwindling daylight; establish earlier turnaround times to allow conservative, methodical descents.
- Pre-rig personal attachments and backups for rappels to reduce dynamic loading if an anchor is compromised.
- Carry and, when possible, promptly use communication devices to initiate SAR from the field after an incident.
