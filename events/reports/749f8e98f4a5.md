# Mountaineering Incident Report

## Executive Summary
- On May 10, 2025, four climbers descended the Early Winter Couloir between the North and South Early Winters Spires (Washington Pass, WA) when an apparent rappel anchor failure involving a weathered piton occurred. 
- All four fell; three climbers died and one survived with serious injuries. The survivor self-evacuated, reached a phone in Newhalem to call 911, and bodies were later recovered by helicopter.

## Location and Context
- Peak/Area: Early Winters Spires — Early Winter Couloir (AI3 M4+), between North and South Early Winters Spires
- Region: Washington Pass, Liberty Bell Group, North Cascades, Washington
- Activity/Style: Alpine climbing (mixed)
- Context: Reported as an approximately 1,100-foot alpine couloir line.

## Timeline of Events
| Time | Event |
|---|---|
| Saturday afternoon | Team climbing the Early Winter Couloir; light snow reported. |
| ~5:30 p.m. | Group decides to retreat as a storm system moves in. |
| Evening (during descent) | Rappel anchor (weathered piton) fails; party falls ~200 ft and slides ~200 ft. |
| Night | Survivor loses consciousness; later wakes around ~10 p.m. and begins self-evacuation in darkness. |
| Overnight–early Sunday | Survivor hikes out over rock and snow, reaches car, drives west, strikes a guardrail, continues to Newhalem, and calls 911 from a payphone (~40–60 miles away). |
| Subsequent days | Bodies recovered by helicopter; survivor hospitalized and reported in satisfactory condition by Wednesday. |

## Technical and Environmental Factors
- Anchor System:
  - Main rappel anchor was a weathered/old-looking piton.
  - Failure mode: piton ripped from the rock.
  - Backup/secondary anchor: unknown.
- Group Exposure:
  - All four climbers attached to the same rope; roped for descent.
- Terrain:
  - Alpine mixed couloir (AI3 M4+) between the Early Winters Spires; reported length ~1,100 ft.
- Environmental Conditions:
  - Light snow with a storm system moving in.
  - Poor visibility; evening/late in the day.

## Causal Analysis
### Proximate Cause
- Failure of a weathered piton used as the main rappel anchor during descent, resulting in a combined ~400-foot fall/slide involving all four climbers.

### Failure Modes
- The piton ripped from the rock under load.
- Redundancy of the anchor system is unknown.

### Contributing Factors
- Technical
  - Use of weathered fixed protection as the primary rappel anchor.
  - All four attached to the same rope during the descent (increasing consequence of a single-point failure).
  - Backup anchor presence/use unknown.
- Environmental
  - Approaching storm and poor visibility.
  - Evening/late hour.
- Human (Individual)
  - No specific individual pre-incident factors documented.
- Human (Team)
  - Group was still on route late in the day and elected to retreat as weather moved in.
  - All four descended while attached to the same rope.

### Decision Review
The team initiated a retreat around 5:30 p.m. as weather deteriorated, with light snowfall and poor visibility. Descent occurred in the evening, a time identified by officials as late to be on the mountain, which can compress decision cycles and reduce margin for error.

During the descent, a weathered piton served as the primary anchor. When it failed, all four climbers, attached to the same rope system, were affected simultaneously. Unknown anchor redundancy and the group’s collective attachment increased the consequences of the single-point failure.

Environmental conditions (storm moving in, poor visibility) and the late hour likely constrained descent options and anchor evaluation time. These factors aligned with a technical system failure to produce a high-consequence outcome.

## Counterfactual Scenarios (Preventability)
| Topic | Original State | Alternative | Avoidability | Expected Effect | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Anchor redundancy | Weathered piton used as main anchor; backup unknown | Add independent backup gear (e.g., removable protection) and equalize | Medium | Reduces likelihood that a single failure leads to a team fall | Moderate |
| Single-person loading on rappel | All four attached to the same rope | Weight the anchor one person at a time; staged rappels | High | Lowers peak load on the anchor; limits cascade consequence | Moderate |
| Avoid sole reliance on weathered fixed piton | Weathered fixed piton used as primary | Replace/augment with fresh placements or relocate to stronger natural anchor | Medium | Improves anchor integrity and failure resistance | Moderate |
| Earlier turnaround | Retreat began ~5:30 p.m. with storm moving in | Turn back earlier to descend in daylight and before weather arrival | Low–Medium | More time/light for anchor assessment and staged descent | Low–Moderate |
| Immediate use of carried GPS/SOS after incident (outcome mitigation) | GPS/communication device carried but not used; delayed notification | Activate SOS/message coordinates from device | High | Faster SAR notification; reduces risks from self-evacuation; no effect on initial fall | Moderate |

## Uncertainties and Gaps
- Investigation is ongoing; no final determinations or forensic anchor analysis available.
- Backup anchor status is unknown; no photos or engineering inspection provided.
- Exact rope configuration, attachment points, and descent method are not detailed.
- Precise timestamps for the fall, notification, SAR arrival, and recoveries are not documented.
- No coroner/medical examiner reports included; mechanisms of fatal injuries are not formally confirmed here.
- Conflicting media details exist in places (e.g., one anomalous date in a source); resolution favored multi-source consensus.

## Rescue and Outcome
- The survivor self-evacuated at night, hiking over snow and rock with an ice tool, reached a vehicle, and drove west to call 911 from a payphone in Newhalem. Darkness and disorientation after head trauma contributed to a delayed emergency notification.
- Responding and involved organizations included the Okanogan County Sheriff’s Office, Snohomish County Helicopter Rescue Team (helicopter extractions), and UW Medicine/Harborview Medical Center.
- Three climbers were recovered by helicopter. The survivor was later reported in satisfactory condition by Wednesday.
- A fifth would-be participant who did not join the climb reported the group overdue.

## Lessons Learned
- Avoid relying on weathered or questionable fixed pitons as a sole rappel anchor; when feasible, back up and equalize with independent gear.
- Limit anchor loading to one person at a time during descent to reduce peak forces and systemic consequences.
- Anticipate deteriorating weather and evening conditions on alpine mixed routes; set conservative turnaround times to retain daylight for complex descents.
- Verify and document anchor redundancy before committing the team to descent.
- Carrying a communication device is not enough—activate SOS promptly after serious incidents to reduce risks associated with self-evacuation in darkness.
