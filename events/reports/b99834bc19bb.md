# {'area_name': 'The Junkyards', 'alternate_names': ['Junkyards'], 'nearby': 'Grassi Lakes', 'region': 'Canmore, Bow Valley', 'state_province': 'Alberta', 'country': 'Canada'} Incident Report

## Executive Summary
- On January 23, 2025, a 33-year-old ice climber, Eugene (Yevhen/Zhenya) Vahin, suffered a fatal unroped fall at The Junkyards near Grassi Lakes in Canmore, Alberta.
- RCMP and Kananaskis Mountain Rescue responded to an overdue-climber report and recovered the body the same day. One person was involved; one fatality was reported.

## Location and Context
- Peak/Area: The Junkyards (also known as Junkyards), near Grassi Lakes
- Region: Canmore, Bow Valley, Alberta, Canada
- Activity/Style: Ice climbing; unroped
- Context: Officials reported a fall at The Junkyards; exact route or feature was not identified.

## Timeline of Events
| Time (approx.) | Event |
|---|---|
| Jan 23 | Missed check-in and overdue report led RCMP to request assistance. |
| Jan 23 | Kananaskis Mountain Rescue deployed to The Junkyards near Grassi Lakes. |
| Jan 23 | Subject located deceased at The Junkyards. |
| ~Evening, Jan 23 | Ground recovery completed; remains transferred to RCMP. |

## Technical and Environmental Factors
- Anchor System: Not reported.
- Roped Status: Unroped.
- Group Exposure: Single climber; no belay present.
- Terrain: Ice climbing at The Junkyards; reported as likely near the top of a route when the slip occurred.
- Environmental Conditions: Not reported.
- Avalanche Indicators: None reported.
- Injury Details: Medical examiners reportedly indicated severe head injury and internal bleeding.

## Causal Analysis
### Proximate Cause
- Unknown. Authorities stated the exact circumstances and fall distance were not determined.

### Failure Modes
- Not determined (no evidence of equipment, anchor, tool, or ice failure specifics; fall dynamics and distance unknown).

### Contributing Factors
- Technical: Unroped ascent; no belay or rope system to arrest a slip.
- Environmental: Conditions (ice quality, temperature, surface features) not reported.
- Human (Individual): Solo climbing; reported to be near the top of a route when the slip likely occurred.
- Human (Team): No partner present; an external check-in plan existed and triggered the response.

### Decision Review
The climb was undertaken unroped and solo, which increased the consequences of any slip. Available reporting suggests the slip occurred near the top of a route, a zone that can present insecure moves and limited options for immediate protection when unroped; however, specific conditions are unknown.

A check-in plan or expectation was in place, as a missed check-in generated an overdue report and initiated the response. While this facilitated timely recovery, it did not affect the outcome given the subject was found deceased on first contact. Without details on conditions, equipment, or precise terrain, further decision-path analysis is not possible.

## Counterfactual Scenarios (Preventability)
| Topic | Original State | Alternative | Avoidability | Expected Effect | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fall arrest | Unroped solo on ice | Climb on belay with a partner | Possibly feasible; partner/gear availability unknown | Potential to arrest a slip and prevent ground fall | Moderate |
| System redundancy | Unroped solo | Top-rope (partner belay) or top-rope solo with redundant progress-capture devices | Feasible where anchors can be safely established; site specifics unknown | Reduces consequence of a slip to a short fall onto system | Low–Moderate |
| Team support | Solo | Climb with a partner (even if not belayed) | Feasible; depends on planning and partner availability | Faster incident detection and activation; prevention uncertain | Low |
| Objective assessment at topout | Proceeded unroped; likely near route top | Rig rope first or retreat if topout security is uncertain | Possibly feasible; depends on anchor access and conditions | May avoid committing unprotected moves near topout | Low |

## Uncertainties and Gaps
- Precise fall distance unknown.
- Exact route or position within The Junkyards not identified.
- Time-of-day details for fall, activation, and recovery not specified.
- Weather, temperature, and ice/surface conditions unreported.
- Equipment details (helmet use, tools, crampons, anchor/protection) not provided.
- No official RCMP or coroner report linked; reliance on media and rescue statements.
- Limited first-hand witness information; fall not captured on the climber’s camera.

## Rescue and Outcome
RCMP requested assistance after an overdue report. Kananaskis Mountain Rescue deployed, located the subject deceased at The Junkyards, and performed a ground carry-out, with four staff noted as responding, transferring the remains to RCMP. Specific medical interventions, timing, and on-scene impediments were not described.

## Lessons Learned
- Unroped soloing on ice leaves no margin for arresting slips; consider using a rope (belay or properly configured top-rope) when consequences are severe.
- If approaching topouts or unfamiliar sections, establish a rope first or reassess before committing to unprotected moves.
- Solo plans should include robust check-in protocols; ensure timely activation if overdue.
- When details are limited post-incident, avoid speculation and focus on conservative risk management in similar scenarios.
