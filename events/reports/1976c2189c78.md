# Mount McKinley Incident Report

## Executive Summary
- On June 2, 2023, a member of a three-person expedition fell approximately 3,000 feet from a feature known as Squirrel Point on Mount McKinley’s (Denali) West Buttress route.
- The fall resulted in one fatality; the other two team members were uninjured. The body was recovered two days later.

## Location and Context
- Peak/Area: Mount McKinley (Denali), West Buttress route; Squirrel Point toward the Peters Glacier.
- Region: North America.
- Activity/Style: Climbing (report text also describes the individual as a ski mountaineer).
- Terrain/Context: An exposed, rocky, and serac-covered face of approximately 3,000 feet.

## Timeline of Events
| Approx. Time | Event |
| --- | --- |
| ~Day of incident (June 2) | Un-roped climber fell from Squirrel Point toward the Peters Glacier on the West Buttress. |
| Immediately after | Teammates lowered over the edge as far as possible but were unable to see or hear the fallen climber. |
| Shortly after | Reporting party descended the West Buttress route to seek additional help and proceeded to Camp 1. |
| ~Two days later | Body recovery completed. |

## Technical and Environmental Factors
- Anchor System: No rope or protection in use at the time of the fall; no anchor failure reported.
- Group Exposure: Three-person expedition; incident occurred on an exposed rocky and serac-covered face.
- Terrain: Steep, complex terrain at Squirrel Point toward the Peters Glacier; West Buttress route.
- Environmental Conditions: Not reported.
- Avalanche Indicators: Not reported.

## Causal Analysis
### Proximate Cause
- Un-roped fall from exposed terrain on the West Buttress near Squirrel Point, resulting in a long, approximately 3,000-foot descent.

### Failure Modes
- No belay or rope team in use; therefore, no protection system was present to arrest the fall.
- No evidence of anchor or equipment failure.

### Contributing Factors
- Technical: Travel un-roped in highly exposed terrain.
- Environmental: Exposed rocky and serac-covered face; limited visibility into the fall line from above (team unable to see/hear after the incident).
- Human (Individual): Insufficient information.
- Human (Team): Insufficient information.

### Decision Review
- The party was un-roped while moving through a highly exposed section. In the event of a slip or loss of balance, no team-based arrest or belay was available to limit consequences.
- After the fall, teammates attempted a limited lower over the edge but reported they could neither see nor hear their partner, suggesting a convex rollover or complex terrain that impeded immediate access and communication.
- The team then descended the route to obtain assistance and proceeded to Camp 1. The remote, technical location contributed to a delayed recovery two days later.

## Counterfactual Scenarios (Preventability)
| Topic | Original State | Alternative | Avoidability | Expected Effect | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rope use on exposed section | Un-roped movement on an exposed face | Employ roped travel and/or belay through the most exposed portion | Terrain- and conditions-dependent; feasibility unknown | Potential to arrest or limit a fall | Low–Moderate |
| Edge management at convex rollover | Team could not see/hear partner after fall | Establish secure belay/stance before committing to the rollover to maintain control/communication | Often practicable but may be constrained by terrain/conditions | Improved oversight and potential immediate response | Low |
| Fixed protection/handline (if available) | No protection in place | Install temporary anchors/handline for passage of the exposed step | Dependent on anchor opportunities and conditions | May reduce likelihood or consequence of a fall | Low |

## Uncertainties and Gaps
- Exact time of the accident is not reported.
- No GPS coordinates, elevation, or precise position beyond “Squirrel Point toward the Peters Glacier.”
- Weather, surface conditions, and slope angles/aspect at the time are unknown.
- Mechanism of the fall (e.g., slip, edge loss, terrain failure) is not described.
- Activity classification is ambiguous (climbing vs. ski mountaineering); the report refers to an “un-roped ski mountaineer,” while the activity field lists “climbing.”
- No details on planned team procedures (e.g., when to rope up) or the party’s experience.
- No operational details of the recovery beyond “recovered two days later.”
- The timeline states “Monday, June 2,” which conflicts with calendar day-of-week for 2023; the precise chronology is unclear.
- Primary information is from a single news report; no official investigative findings are provided.

## Rescue and Outcome
- Responding Agency: National Park Service.
- Impediments: Teammates were unable to see or hear the fallen climber from above, indicating difficult, complex terrain.
- Outcome: One fatality; body recovery occurred two days after the incident.

## Lessons Learned
- Consider roped travel and/or a belay when crossing highly exposed, serac- and rock-affected terrain where a fall would be unsurvivable.
- Establish secure stances and, where feasible, protection before committing to convex rollovers or blind edges to maintain control and communication.
- Pre-plan immediate post-fall actions and communication protocols for complex terrain where visual or audible contact may be lost.
- Identify potential anchor opportunities in advance of exposed passages to enable rapid deployment of a handline or belay if conditions warrant.
- Recognize that in remote, steep terrain, immediate access to a fallen partner may be impossible; incorporate this into risk assessment and spacing.
