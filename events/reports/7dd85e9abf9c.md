# Mount Test Incident Report

## Executive Summary
- On January 1, 2025, a climber fell approximately 12.5 meters on the North Ridge of Mount Test in the BC Coast Mountains. 
- Two people were involved; one person was injured and no fatalities were reported.
- Responders from Squamish SAR and RCMP assisted; a helicopter hoist was used despite high winds, and one individual was rescued.

## Location and Context
- Peak/Area: Mount Test, North Ridge
- Region: BC Coast Mountains
- Activity/Style: Climbing
- Context: Limited terrain detail is available beyond the route name; no technical grade or approach information is provided.

## Timeline of Events
| Time (approx.) | Event |
|---|---|
| ~3 PM (Afternoon), Jan 1, 2025 | Fall occurred on the North Ridge of Mount Test. |
| Afternoon | Callout initiated; Squamish SAR and RCMP notified. High winds reported. |
| Afternoon (time unspecified) | Helicopter hoist conducted; one person rescued. |

## Technical and Environmental Factors
- Anchor System: Anchor inspected; no anchor failure reported.
- Group Exposure: Two-person party; specific roles and rope systems not described.
- Terrain: North Ridge of Mount Test; no pitch-by-pitch or protection details provided.
- Environmental Conditions: Conditions were described as icy; high winds affected rescue operations.
- Avalanche Indicators: None reported.

## Causal Analysis
### Proximate Cause
- The immediate event was a fall of approximately 12.5 meters. How the fall was initiated is not specified.

### Failure Modes
- No anchor failure was reported. No evidence of equipment breakage or system malfunction is provided.

### Contributing Factors
- Technical
  - Anchor inspected with no reported failure; no additional system details available.
- Environmental
  - Icy conditions noted, which can increase slip potential.
- Human (Individual)
  - No information on actions, experience, or condition of individuals involved.
- Human (Team)
  - No information on team roles, communication, or procedures.

### Decision Review
- The incident occurred in icy conditions, which are known to increase slip risk; however, the specific decision path that led to the fall is not documented.
- The party did not self-rescue. A SAR callout was made, and responders executed a helicopter hoist in high winds, indicating a timely and resource-intensive response under challenging conditions.
- Family and participant statements express gratitude to rescuers, but do not provide decision-making details relevant to the technical cause.

## Counterfactual Scenarios (Preventability)
| Topic | Original State | Alternative | Avoidability | Expected Effect | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Surface conditions | Icy conditions present | Postpone or select a less exposed objective until conditions improve | Possibly avoidable | Reduced likelihood of a slip-related fall | Low–Moderate |
| Rescue operations | Helicopter hoist conducted in high winds | Delay hoist until wind decreases or consider a ground-based approach | Context-dependent | Lower operational risk to rescuers; patient impact uncertain | Low |

## Uncertainties and Gaps
- Exact accident time beyond “afternoon” and “~3 PM” not established; no sequence for callout, arrival, or extraction.
- No GPS coordinates, elevation, or precise location details on the route.
- Initiating cause of the fall is unknown (e.g., slip, protection failure, belay issue).
- Equipment specifics are missing (rope system, protection used, footwear/traction, condition of gear).
- No information on the second party member’s status or actions.
- No weather data beyond “icy” conditions; wind quantified only as “high winds” affecting rescue.
- No avalanche, rockfall, or objective hazard assessment provided.
- No medical details beyond counts (one injured, zero fatalities).
- No details on team roles, experience levels, or decision-making.
- No official SAR or investigative reports available.

## Rescue and Outcome
- Responders: Squamish SAR and RCMP.
- Method: Helicopter hoist.
- Impediments: High winds.
- Outcome: One person rescued; one person injured; no fatalities reported. No self-rescue.
- Statements: Family expressed thanks to rescuers (“We are grateful for the rescue.”).

## Lessons Learned
- Anticipate and assess the added slip risk posed by icy surfaces; adjust objectives or tactics accordingly.
- Recognize that moderate-height falls (~12.5 m) can cause injury even without equipment failure; manage exposure conservatively on ridge terrain.
- Factor in aviation limitations: high winds can complicate or delay helicopter operations; plan contingencies for prolonged on-scene time.
- Early coordination with local SAR and clear communication can expedite an appropriate response when self-rescue is not feasible.
