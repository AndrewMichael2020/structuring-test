During descent/rappel, a weathered piton anchor reportedly failed, sending all four down roughly 200 ft and then another ~200 ft down a couloir/chute. Three climbers died; the survivor, Anton Tselykh, suffered internal injuries and head trauma, self-evacuated in darkness to his car, drove west to Newhalem, and called 911 from a payphone. Recovery of the deceased was conducted by helicopter.",
