# Mount McKinley Incident Report

## Executive Summary
- On or before June 2, 2023, a member of a three-person team fell more than 3,000 feet from Squirrel Point toward the Peters Glacier on Mount McKinley (Denali), West Buttress route.
- The climber, identified as Alex Chiu (41, Seattle), was un-roped at the time and did not survive. No other injuries were reported.
- Teammates were unable to locate him immediately after the fall and descended for help.
- The body was recovered two days later.

## Location and Context
- Peak/Area: Mount McKinley (Denali), West Buttress; Squirrel Point toward the Peters Glacier.
- Region: North America.
- Activity/Style: Climbing (reports also reference ski mountaineering).
- Terrain/Context: Described as an exposed rocky and serac-covered face of approximately 3,000 feet.

## Timeline of Events
| Time (approx.) | Event |
|---|---|
| ~Time unknown (day of incident) | Chiu fell un-roped from Squirrel Point toward the Peters Glacier on the West Buttress. |
| Immediately after | Teammates lowered over the edge as far as possible but could not see or hear him. |
| Following initial attempts | Team descended the West Buttress seeking additional help and proceeded to Camp 1. |
| “Monday, June 2” | The other two team members reported the fall. |
| Two days later | Body recovered. |

## Technical and Environmental Factors
- Anchor System: None in use at time of fall; no anchor failure reported.
- Group Exposure: Three-person team; one member moving un-roped on long-fall terrain.
- Terrain: Exposed, rocky and serac-covered face (~3,000 feet) at Squirrel Point toward Peters Glacier.
- Environmental Conditions: Not reported.
- Avalanche Indicators: Not reported.
- Communication/Visibility: Teammates were unable to see or hear the fallen climber after initial lowering.

## Causal Analysis
### Proximate Cause
- Un-roped fall from exposed terrain with long fall potential.

### Failure Modes
- Lack of protection/rope system on consequential terrain.
- Self-rescue not possible due to loss of visual and auditory contact and terrain complexity.

### Contributing Factors
- Technical
  - Un-roped movement on exposed, long-fall terrain.
  - Significant vertical relief between the route and Peters Glacier.
- Environmental
  - Steep, rocky and serac-covered face complicating arrest, visibility, and access.
- Human (Individual)
  - Moving un-roped in no-fall terrain (specific rationale unknown).
- Human (Team)
  - Team could not establish or maintain visual/auditory contact after the fall; resorted to descending for help.

### Decision Review
The team was on an exposed section where the consequence of a slip was severe. The fallen climber was un-roped, leaving no immediate means for partner arrest or a controlled belay. After the fall, teammates made a limited descent by lowering over the edge but were unable to locate or communicate with the fallen climber, indicating complex terrain and limited visibility.

Given the inability to effect self-rescue, the remaining members appropriately descended to seek outside assistance. The reporting and subsequent recovery occurred over a multi-day window, consistent with the terrain and logistical challenges described.

## Counterfactual Scenarios (Preventability)
| Topic | Original State | Alternative | Avoidability | Expected Effect | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Protection on exposed traverse | Un-roped movement on exposed, rocky/serac-covered face | Use of rope with belay and/or running protection | Possibly feasible depending on terrain conditions and anchors | Could reduce fall length and injury severity; may enable partner arrest or capture | Low–Moderate |
| Commitment point management | Team positioned without maintained visual on fall line | Establish protected stance and maintained visual before entering no-fall terrain | Generally feasible with planning | Improves monitoring and initial response if a slip occurs | Low |
| Route hazard mitigation at Squirrel Point | Entry onto serac-covered, long-fall terrain | Reroute or delay crossing pending safer line/conditions (if available) | Unknown; depends on conditions and options | Potentially reduces exposure to long-fall and overhead hazards | Low |

## Uncertainties and Gaps
- Exact time of the fall, reporting, and recovery.
- Calendar discrepancy in the phrase “Monday, June 2.”
- Detailed mechanism of the fall (slip, edge failure, ice/serac involvement) is unknown.
- Full equipment list, whether skis were in use, and specific protection options at the site.
- Weather, visibility, and surface conditions at the time.
- Teammates’ detailed statements, experience levels, and decision-making process.
- Recovery method specifics (air/ground) and exact agency units involved.

## Rescue and Outcome
The two teammates reported the incident and descended the West Buttress to seek help, proceeding to Camp 1. The National Park Service is named among response agencies. The body was recovered two days later. Immediate self-rescue was not possible due to lack of visual and auditory contact with the fallen climber in complex terrain.

## Lessons Learned
- Treat Squirrel Point and similar exposed sections as no-fall terrain; pre-plan protection strategies before committing.
- Consider roping up and/or using belays or running protection on long-fall traverses when feasible.
- Establish protected observation positions and maintain visual when a partner enters consequential terrain.
- Predefine team thresholds for transitioning between un-roped and roped travel based on consequence, not only difficulty.
- Recognize that once a fall occurs into steep glaciated terrain, rapid partner access and communication can be lost; emphasize prevention.
