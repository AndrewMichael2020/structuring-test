# {'region': 'Washington Pass, Washington, USA', 'area': 'Liberty Bell Group', 'mountain_name': 'Early Winters Spires (Liberty Bell Group)', 'nearby_feature': 'North Early Winters Spire', 'route_name': 'Early Winter Couloir'} Incident Report

## Executive Summary
- On May 10, 2025, a party of four retreating from Early Winter Couloir at Washington Pass experienced a rappel anchor failure. 
- All four fell roughly 400 feet combined; three climbers died and one survived with serious injuries.
- The survivor self-evacuated and later reached help; the three deceased were recovered by helicopter.

## Location and Context
- Peak/Area, Region, Activity/Style:
  - Early Winters Spires (Liberty Bell Group), near North Early Winters Spire; Washington Pass, Washington, USA.
  - Route: Early Winter Couloir (AI3, M4+).
  - Activity: Alpine mixed climbing.
- Terrain/Context:
  - Team was about halfway up the approximately 1,100-foot couloir when weather moved in; retreat initiated by rappel.

## Timeline of Events
| Time (approx.) | Event |
|---|---|
| Afternoon | Party reaches about halfway up Early Winter Couloir; weather moves in. |
| ~5:30 p.m. | Team decides to retreat. |
| Evening | All four attach to the same rope for descent by rappel. |
| Evening | Anchor reportedly fails; ~200 ft near-vertical fall followed by ~200 ft slide/tumble in a rocky, partially snow-covered chute. |
| ~10:00 p.m. | Survivor regains consciousness. |
| Night | Survivor crawls/hikes to vehicle in darkness, drives west over the pass (collides with a guardrail) to seek help. |
| Later | Bodies recovered by Snohomish County helicopter rescue team. |

## Technical and Environmental Factors
- Anchor System:
  - Single, very weathered piton reportedly used as the rappel anchor; piton pulled from the rock.
  - Whether any backup was in place is unknown.
- Rope/Descent System:
  - All four were attached to the same rope for descent; anchor blew while rappelling and all four fell simultaneously.
  - Rope type and knots: unknown.
- Group Exposure:
  - Simultaneous attachment/load led to group-wide consequence when the anchor failed.
- Terrain:
  - Near-vertical section transitioning into a rocky, partially snow-covered chute.
  - Estimated fall: ~200 ft vertical plus ~200 ft additional slide/tumble.
- Environmental Conditions:
  - Weather change occurred during the climb; retreat began late in the day.
  - Darkness present during survivor’s self-evacuation.

## Causal Analysis
### Proximate Cause
- Failure of a single, weathered piton used as a rappel anchor; the piton pulled, resulting in a simultaneous fall of the roped party.

### Failure Modes
- Reliance on a single-point anchor (weathered piton).
- Reported anchor pull under load during rappel.
- All four climbers attached to the same rope, creating system-wide exposure to anchor failure.
- Backup protection presence is unknown.

### Contributing Factors
- Technical:
  - Single-point, weathered fixed piton used for rappel.
  - All four attached to the same rope; simultaneous exposure to anchor failure.
  - Unknown rope type and knot configuration.
- Environmental:
  - Weather moving in during the ascent.
  - Late-in-day retreat and subsequent darkness.
- Human (Individual):
  - Not established.
- Human (Team):
  - Time pressure associated with weather and late hour.
  - Descent strategy exposed the entire group to a single anchor point.

### Decision Review
- The team observed deteriorating weather about halfway up the route and decided to retreat around 5:30 p.m. The decision to descend as conditions changed indicates situational awareness, but it also placed the team on rappel late in the day.
- During the descent, the reported reliance on a single, weathered piton created a single point of failure. With all four attached to the same rope, anchor failure propagated to the entire team.
- Darkness and time pressure likely increased the consequences of any error or equipment failure, though their direct effect on anchor construction or checks is not documented.

## Counterfactual Scenarios (Preventability)
| Topic | Original State | Alternative | Avoidability | Expected Effect | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Rappel anchor redundancy | Single, weathered piton reportedly used; backup unknown | Independent, multi-point anchor (e.g., additional protection) | Possibly feasible; specific placements at that station unknown | Reduced likelihood of total anchor failure | Low–Moderate |
| Load management at anchor | All four attached to the same rope; simultaneous consequence | One-at-a-time weighting with independent attachments to the system | Generally feasible | Lower peak load on any single point; limits group-wide consequence | Moderate |
| Earlier retreat timing | Retreat initiated ~5:30 p.m. as weather moved in | Turnaround/retreat earlier in the day | Situational; depends on when weather signs appeared | More daylight/time margin for anchor selection and verification | Low |
| Emergency communications | Survivor self-evacuated without GPS communicator | Use of satellite communicator to contact SAR from scene | Generally feasible | Faster notification and response; no effect on anchor failure mechanism | Moderate |

## Uncertainties and Gaps
- Exact clock time of the fall is unknown; most times are approximate.
- Whether the rappel anchor was backed up is unknown; details of the full anchor build and precise failure sequence are not documented.
- Rope type, diameter, age, and knot configuration are unknown.
- No forensic/engineering analysis of the failed piton or rock is provided.
- Which pitch/rappel station was used is unspecified; feasibility of multi-point protection at that location is unknown.
- Team experience and internal decision-making processes are not documented.
- Specific weather parameters (wind, temperature, precipitation intensity/visibility) and route surface conditions at the anchor are not provided.
- Date discrepancy in some reports (Saturday vs. Sunday) noted in secondary sources.
- No primary SAR/police/coroner reports are included.

## Rescue and Outcome
- Outcome: Three fatalities; one survivor with internal bleeding and a traumatic brain injury (no broken bones reported).
- Response:
  - Survivor self-evacuated on foot to the vehicle in darkness and drove west over the pass to seek help.
  - Bodies were recovered by the Snohomish County helicopter rescue team.
  - Agencies referenced: Okanogan County Sheriff’s Office; UW Medicine (Harborview Medical Center, Seattle).
- Impediments:
  - Darkness and the survivor’s head injury contributed to disorientation; the survivor drove the wrong direction and collided with a guardrail.
  - No GPS communication device was used to summon help from the scene.

## Lessons Learned
- Treat fixed pitons—especially weathered ones—as suspect; back up with independent protection whenever possible.
- Avoid single-point rappel anchors; build redundant, independent systems suited to mixed terrain.
- Manage anchor loads: limit simultaneous weighting and keep only one person on rappel at a time where practical.
- Anticipate late-day retreats in alpine terrain; establish conservative turnaround times to preserve daylight for complex descents.
- Carry and know how to use a satellite communication device to expedite SAR notification when self-evacuation is risky or delayed.
