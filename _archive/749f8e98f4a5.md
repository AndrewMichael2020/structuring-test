# Mountaineering Incident Report

## Executive Summary
- On May 10, 2025, a four-person alpine climbing team retreated from Early Winter Couloir on the Early Winters Spires (Washington Pass) as a storm moved in. During the descent, a weathered fixed piton anchor reportedly failed, leading to an estimated ~400-foot combined fall and slide.
- Three climbers were killed and one was injured. The survivor self-evacuated, reached a vehicle in darkness, and later notified authorities.

## Location and Context
- Peak/Area: Early Winters Spires (between North and South), North Early Winters Spire area
- Region: Washington, Cascades; Washington Pass, Liberty Bell Group
- Activity/Style: Alpine climbing; Early Winter Couloir (AI3 M4+)
- Terrain/Context: Retreat/rappel on mixed alpine terrain with a near-vertical section above a rocky, partially snow-covered chute (as reported).

## Timeline of Events
| Approx. Time | Event |
|---|---|
| ~5:30 p.m. (Saturday) | Team decided to retreat as a storm moved in. |
| Evening | During descent/rappel, the piton anchor reportedly failed; all four fell. |
| ~10:00 p.m. | Survivor reported regaining consciousness. |
| Night | Survivor extricated self, descended over rock and snow to vehicle in darkness. |
| Night | Survivor drove west, collided with a guardrail en route, and called 911 from a payphone in Newhalem. |
| Later (time unspecified) | Recovery of the deceased conducted by helicopter. |

## Technical and Environmental Factors
- Anchor System
  - Type: Fixed piton
  - Condition: Weathered/old-looking
  - Failure mode: Piton ripped from rock (reported)
  - Backup: Unknown
- Group Exposure
  - Roped for descent; all four attached to the same rope
- Terrain
  - ~200 ft near-vertical fall followed by ~200 ft tumble/slide down a rocky, partially snow-covered chute
- Environmental Conditions
  - Light snow with a storm moving in during afternoon/evening
  - Poor visibility/darkness after the fall

## Causal Analysis
### Proximate Cause
- Reported failure of a weathered fixed piton used as a descent anchor.

### Failure Modes
- Piton ripped from rock (reported; exact mechanics unconfirmed).

### Contributing Factors
- Technical
  - Reliance on a single, weathered fixed piton (rope found attached to one piton).
- Environmental
  - Deteriorating weather (storm arrival, light snow) and poor visibility/darkness.
- Human (Individual)
  - No specific individual-level factors documented.
- Human (Team)
  - All four attached to a single rope during descent.
  - Retreat initiated late in the day.

### Decision Review
The team chose to retreat around 5:30 p.m. as weather deteriorated. Descent occurred in worsening conditions with diminishing light, increasing time pressure and exposure to environmental hazards.

A weathered fixed piton was used as the descent anchor, and all four climbers were attached to the same rope. When the reported anchor failure occurred, the entire party was exposed to a single-point failure, resulting in a collective fall. Darkness and continued poor weather complicated the survivor’s self-evacuation and subsequent response efforts.

## Counterfactual Scenarios (Preventability)
| Topic | Original State | Alternative | Avoidability | Expected Effect | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Anchor redundancy | Single, weathered fixed piton | Two independent, redundant placements (e.g., additional removable protection or second fixed point) | Moderate | Reduces probability of total anchor failure under load | Low–Moderate |
| Group exposure on rope | All four attached to the same rope | Sequential rappels/only one person on rope at a time | Moderate | Limits consequences of an anchor failure to fewer people | Moderate |
| Descent timing | Retreat late in day with storm arriving | Earlier turnaround or waiting for safer window | Low–Moderate | Improves visibility and reduces haste during anchor building/use | Low |
| Backing up fixed gear | Reliance on weathered piton | Back up or replace fixed piton if possible | Moderate | Increases anchor reliability under varying rock/ice conditions | Low–Moderate |

## Uncertainties and Gaps
- Exact clock time of the fall and subsequent events is imprecise.
- Forensic confirmation of the piton’s failure mechanics (shear, pullout, or rock failure) is not available.
- Whether a backup/independent anchor was present is unknown.
- Detailed rope configuration beyond “all attached to the same rope” is unclear (e.g., sequence, strand usage).
- Survivor’s recollection may be affected by head trauma and hypothermia.
- No official technical/forensic report or on-scene equipment examination included in the sources.
- Precise location on the route and availability/quality of alternative anchor placements are not documented.

## Rescue and Outcome
Response involved the Okanogan County Sheriff’s Office, with recovery operations supported by the Snohomish County Helicopter Rescue Team. Darkness, deteriorating weather, and the survivor’s disorientation impeded immediate response. The survivor self-evacuated to a vehicle and called 911 from a payphone in Newhalem; three climbers were later recovered by helicopter. The survivor was subsequently treated at Harborview Medical Center (UW Medicine).

## Lessons Learned
- Treat fixed pitons as suspect; back them up with independent, high-quality placements whenever possible.
- Avoid committing an entire team to a single point of failure; use sequential rappels to minimize group exposure.
- Anticipate deteriorating weather and darkness; set conservative turnaround times for complex alpine descents.
- In poor conditions, prioritize anchor redundancy and verification even if it adds time.
- Ensure carried communication devices are ready and used to initiate emergency contact when feasible.
