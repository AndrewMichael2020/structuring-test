# Mountaineering Incident Report

## Executive Summary
- On January 23 (year uncertain; likely 2025), a 33-year-old ice climber fell while climbing unroped at The Junkyards near Grassi Lakes in the Bow Valley, Alberta.
- After a missed 4:00 p.m. check-in, a search and subsequent callout led RCMP and Kananaskis Mountain Rescue to locate the climber later that evening. Outcome: one fatality; no other injuries reported.

## Location and Context
- Peak/Area: The Junkyards (near Grassi Lakes), near Canmore
- Region: Bow Valley, Alberta, Canada
- Activity/Style: Ice climbing; unroped/solo
- Context: Last video showed the climber standing at the edge of the ice with earth/grass nearby, consistent with being near the top of a route.

## Timeline of Events
| Time (local) | Event |
|---|---|
| 15:44 | Last camera timestamp; subject near the edge of ice with nearby ground/grass. |
| ~16:00 | Missed scheduled check-in; spouse becomes concerned. |
| ~17:00 | Spouse begins search, slips ~50 feet on an icy slope, self-arrests on a tree, and calls emergency services. |
| Evening (same day) | RCMP and Kananaskis Mountain Rescue locate the climber deceased and recover the body. |

## Technical and Environmental Factors
- Anchor System: None in use; the climber was unroped.
- Group Exposure: Solo ascent; no partner present.
- Terrain: Ice route with a transition zone at the edge/top where ice bordered ground/vegetation; fall distance unknown.
- Environmental Conditions: Icy surface noted on approach/slope (spouse slipped during search); no additional weather data available.
- Avalanche Indicators: None reported.
- Equipment:
  - Crampons; one was returned without a strap (cause/timing unknown).
  - Camera present; incident not captured. Last timestamp at 15:44.

## Causal Analysis
### Proximate Cause
- Unroped slip or trip near the top of an ice route.

### Failure Modes
- Loss of purchase or balance at the ice-to-ground/vegetation transition.
- Absence of a rope or anchor eliminated any fall-arrest capability.
- Possible equipment issue (missing crampon strap), though its timing and relevance are unknown.

### Contributing Factors
- Technical
  - Technical skill mismatch (estimated beginner).
  - Movement near a topout/edge without protection.
  - Filming activity in proximity to an edge.
- Environmental
  - Edge/transition terrain from ice to earth/grass.
  - Icy surface conditions noted elsewhere on slope.
- Human (Individual)
  - Solo decision-making.
  - High inferred risk tolerance.
  - Familiarity/acceptance heuristics suggested by next of kin.
- Human (Team)
  - Group size: one; no partner to provide belay, oversight, or cross-checks.

### Decision Review
- The last confirmed activity at 15:44 shows the climber near the edge of the ice while filming. A missed 16:00 check-in and subsequent callout suggest the fall occurred in the short interval after the last recording and before the evening search.
- Transitioning at the edge of an ice route while unroped concentrates exposure. With no anchors or belay, even a minor slip becomes non-survivable. A strap missing from one crampon was reported post hoc, but whether it contributed cannot be determined.
- Heuristic influences tied to familiarity with the local crag, combined with solo, unprotected movement and limited experience, likely narrowed margins at the most consequential part of the climb.

## Counterfactual Scenarios (Preventability)
| Topic | Original State | Alternative | Avoidability | Expected Effect | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fall protection | Unroped at the top edge | Use of rope/belay/protection | Medium | Increased chance to arrest a slip if anchors/protection were feasible | Low–Medium (anchor/fall path unknown) |
| Partner presence | Solo | Climb with a competent partner | High | Enables belay/oversight; may reduce unprotected movement | Low–Medium |
| Filming near edge | Filming while near the edge/top | Capture footage from a secure stance or after building protection | High | Reduces exposure during content capture | Medium |
| Crampon retention | One crampon later returned missing a strap | Verify/secure straps; carry spares | High | If strap loss contributed, reduces risk of foot disengagement | Low |
| Check-in interval | 16:00 single check-in | Shorter intervals or live tracking | Medium | Faster notification/response; survival impact unknown | Low |

## Uncertainties and Gaps
- Exact year is not confirmed; inferred as 2025 with low confidence.
- Exact time and mechanism of the fall were not captured on camera.
- Whether the missing crampon strap predated or followed the fall is unknown.
- Fall distance and precise landing terrain are unknown.
- No detailed weather, ice quality, or avalanche context provided.
- No official technical narrative from investigators is included in the sources.
- Injury mechanism is reported second-hand; no coroner report provided.
- Precise SAR dispatch, arrival times, and recovery method details are not available.

## Rescue and Outcome
- Responding agencies: Kananaskis Mountain Rescue and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).
- Four Kananaskis Mountain Rescue staff conducted a body recovery and transferred remains to RCMP.
- The spouse initiated a search prior to calling for help and experienced a slip on icy terrain.
- Outcome: one fatality. Detailed rescue timeline and recovery method specifics were not provided.

## Lessons Learned
- Maintain protective margins at topouts and edges; treat ice-to-ground transitions as high-consequence terrain.
- Avoid unprotected movement when distracted by filming; gather content from secure stances or under belay.
- Solo, unroped ice climbing greatly reduces error tolerance; consider partners and protection in exposed zones.
- Inspect crampon components before and during climbs; replace worn straps and carry spares.
- Familiar venues can obscure objective hazards; apply the same caution as on unfamiliar terrain.
- Establish check-in plans recognizing they aid response but do not mitigate fall consequences.
