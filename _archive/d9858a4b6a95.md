title: Index Town Wall — fall during anchor/rope transition (unattached) ()
description: A climber in his 20s fell approximately 300 feet at Index Town Wall while transitioning at the top anchors of Slow Children. Witness accounts suggest he detached from the rope and was not clipped to the anchors before falling. Responders found him deceased.

# Index Town Wall Incident Report

## Executive Summary
- A climber in his 20s fell approximately 300 feet at Index Town Wall (Lower Town Wall) around 4 p.m. while transitioning at the top anchors of Slow Children (5.10d). 
- Witness accounts and subsequent checks indicate the climber became detached from both the rope and the anchor. 
- Sky Valley Fire search and rescue responded and found the climber deceased. 
- Party size: 3; Fatalities: 1; Injured: 0.

## Location and Context
- Peak/Area: Index Town Wall, Lower Town Wall (Slow Children)
- Region: Washington, USA
- Activity/Style: Rock climbing; three-person link-up of Godzilla, City Park, and Slow Children; mixed top-rope and lead climbing
- Terrain/Context: Granite wall. Belay ledge at the base of Slow Children estimated ~200 ft above ground; top anchor stance described as very small and out of sight from the belay ledge.

## Timeline of Events
| Time | Event |
|---|---|
| Morning–Midday (approx.) | Party met at Index; discussed link-up objectives. |
| Afternoon (over ~3 hours) | Climbed Godzilla and City Park; then Slow Children. Leader fell twice at the crux of Slow Children and completed the pitch. |
| Shortly before ~4 p.m. | Leader reached the top of Slow Children to clean the anchor; out of sight from belayers on the ledge. |
| ~4 p.m. | Witnesses reported an uncontrolled fall; rope fell back to belayers. 911 calls made. |
| After ~4 p.m. | Sky Valley Fire SAR responded; climber located and confirmed deceased. Another climber later checked the top anchor and reported it solid. |

## Technical and Environmental Factors
- Anchor System: Two-bolt anchor with quickdraws in place; redundancy present; anchor later checked and reported solid; no evidence of anchor hardware failure.
- Rope/Protection: Single rope, pitched belay; leader had placed 8–10 pieces on the lead. Rope returned to belayers after the fall, indicating the climber was unattached to the rope at the time.
- Group Exposure: Three-person team; two at a ledge ~200 ft up; leader at a small, out-of-sight stance near the top (~300 ft).
- Terrain: Steep granite wall; top stance reported very small.
- Environmental Conditions: Not reported.

## Causal Analysis
### Proximate Cause
- Miscommunication associated with the anchor transition, coincident with the climber becoming unattached from both rope and anchors during cleaning/threading at the top.

### Failure Modes
- Complete detachment from the rope while not clipped to the anchor during the transition.
- No evidence of anchor hardware failure; anchor inspected and reported solid.
- Belay could not arrest the fall because the leader was no longer tied in.

### Contributing Factors
- Technical
  - No active backup to the anchor during the transition (loss of redundancy).
  - Small stance at the anchors increased complexity of safe threading/cleaning.
- Environmental
  - Not reported.
- Human (Individual)
  - Probable procedural error during threading/cleaning at the anchor.
- Human (Team)
  - Communication lapse; belayers did not hear an “off belay” call.
  - Loss of visual contact between belay ledge and anchor stance.

### Decision Review
The team transitioned from a top-rope setup to a lead of Slow Children. At the top, the leader was responsible for cleaning the anchor where quickdraws had been left. The anchor stance was very small and out of sight from the belayers on a ledge roughly 200 feet below.

Witness accounts indicate no “off belay” was heard. Approximately a minute later, the leader fell and the rope dropped back to the belay ledge, consistent with the leader having untied before clipping into the anchor. With no backup connection to the anchors, the transition exposed the leader to a ground fall potential from the top of the route.

Given the sound condition of the anchor and the rope returning to the belayers, the outcome aligns with a procedural/communication failure during the threading/cleaning sequence rather than equipment failure.

## Counterfactual Scenarios (Preventability)
| Topic | Original State | Alternative | Avoidability | Expected Effect | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Continuous attachment during transition | No active backup to anchor; leader likely untied to thread | Clip a personal tether or clove-hitch to the anchor before untying | High | Prevents complete detachment even if the rope is untied | High |
| Positive call-and-response | Belayers did not hear “off belay” | Require explicit, confirmed verbal exchange before any detachment | Medium | Reduces miscommunication at critical moment | Medium |
| Maintain belay until confirmation | Leader out of sight; detachment timing unknown | Keep leader on belay until visual/verbal confirmation of secure anchor attachment | Medium | Provides protection while still tied; may prevent exposure during early steps | Medium |
| Assign most practiced person to thread/clean | Leader who fell managed the anchor transition | Delegate threading/cleaning to the most practiced team member when stance is small/out of sight | Possible | Lowers procedural error likelihood at a complex stance | Low–Medium |

## Uncertainties and Gaps
- Exact sequence at the anchor was not observed; precise mechanism of detachment is unknown.
- Whether a formal “off belay” exchange occurred is unclear.
- Knots and specific attachment methods used are unknown.
- Exact pitch/anchor location details and coordinates not provided.
- Weather/light conditions at the time were not reported.
- Experience levels and formal training of the climbers are not confirmed.
- Single news source; no official technical investigation or medical examiner report cited.

## Rescue and Outcome
- Responders: Sky Valley Fire search and rescue.
- Timing: 911 calls around 4 p.m.; detailed SAR timeline not provided.
- Impediments: Recovery difficulty described as moderate; specific logistical details not provided.
- Outcome: One fatality; no injuries among team members.

## Lessons Learned
- Maintain continuous attachment to the anchor (tether or clove-hitch) before untying for threading or cleaning.
- Use clear, confirmed call-and-response before any detachment, especially when the leader is out of sight.
- Keep the climber on belay until explicit confirmation of secure anchor attachment is established.
- Anticipate small or awkward anchor stances and add redundancy before starting any transition.
- Assign anchor threading/cleaning to the most practiced team member when visibility is limited.
- Rehearse anchor-threading procedures on the ground and agree on standard protocols before the climb.
