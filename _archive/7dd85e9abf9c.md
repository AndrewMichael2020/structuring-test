# Mount Test Incident Report

## Executive Summary
- On the afternoon of 2025-01-01, a climber fell approximately 12.5 meters on the North Ridge of Mount Test in the BC Coast Mountains.
- Two people were involved; one was injured and there were no fatalities. One person was rescued.

## Location and Context
- Peak/Area: Mount Test, North Ridge
- Region: BC Coast Mountains
- Activity/Style: Climbing
- Context: Local commentary described conditions as icy.

## Timeline of Events
| Time | Event |
|---|---|
| ~3:00 PM (Afternoon) | Fall occurred on the North Ridge; one climber injured. |
| Afternoon | Emergency services were notified. |
| Afternoon | Squamish SAR and RCMP became involved. |
| Afternoon | A helicopter hoist extracted one person. |

## Technical and Environmental Factors
- Anchor System: Anchor was inspected; no anchor failure was reported.
- Group Exposure: Party of two; one injured.
- Terrain: North Ridge of Mount Test; reported fall height approximately 12.5 meters.
- Environmental Conditions: Icy conditions noted; high winds affected the response.

## Causal Analysis
### Proximate Cause
- A fall during climbing on the North Ridge. Specific mechanism was not reported.

### Failure Modes
- No anchor failure reported. Other potential failure modes (foot slip, protection spacing, rope handling) are not documented.

### Contributing Factors
- Technical: Unknown; anchor was inspected, with no failure indicated.
- Environmental: Icy conditions present; high winds impacted rescue operations.
- Human (Individual): Not reported.
- Human (Team): Not reported.

### Decision Review
- The incident occurred in the afternoon under icy conditions. How the party assessed or adapted to these surface conditions is not documented.
- A helicopter hoist was used for extraction, with high winds reported as a difficulty. This choice is consistent with rapid access in complex terrain, though operational details are not provided.
- Limited information on team decisions, movement tactics, and protection strategies prevents a fuller linkage between conditions, procedures, and outcome.

## Counterfactual Scenarios (Preventability)
| Topic | Original State | Alternative | Avoidability | Expected Effect | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Objective/Timing in Icy Conditions | Proceeded onto North Ridge with icy conditions reported | Postpone, choose a different objective, or adjust timing to avoid icy surfaces | Sometimes feasible | Reduced likelihood of a slip-and-fall | Low–Moderate |
| Movement on Icy Terrain | Climbing on icy surfaces; protection/rope strategy not described | Increase security appropriate to conditions (e.g., slower movement, terrain assessment, conservative protection if applicable) | Generally feasible | Lower probability or consequence of a fall | Low |
| Air Operations in High Winds | Helicopter hoist conducted amid high winds | Delay hoist until winds subside or use ground-based methods if safe | Situational | Potentially reduced aviation risk; effect on patient condition unknown | Low |

## Uncertainties and Gaps
- No official investigative report available.
- Exact sequence and timing for notification, SAR arrival, and extraction are not provided beyond “around 3 PM.”
- Identity, role, and condition of the second person are not reported.
- Technical details of the system in use at the time of the fall (rope status, protection, belay method, hardware specifics) are unknown.
- Injury type and medical outcome after rescue are not described.
- Objective environmental data (temperature, wind speeds on scene, precipitation) are absent.
- Only a single news source is cited; no corroborating reports are provided.

## Rescue and Outcome
- Responders: Squamish Search and Rescue, with RCMP involvement.
- Method: Helicopter hoist extraction.
- Impediments: High winds were reported during the response.
- Outcome: One person rescued and one person injured; no fatalities. The family expressed gratitude to rescuers.

## Lessons Learned
- Treat icy surface conditions as a primary hazard; consider delaying, rerouting, or adjusting tactics accordingly.
- When conditions are slick, adopt conservative movement and protection strategies proportional to the terrain.
- Anticipate that high winds can constrain air operations; carry reliable communications and be prepared for delays.
- Verify anchors and overall system integrity, and reassess their suitability as surface conditions change.
