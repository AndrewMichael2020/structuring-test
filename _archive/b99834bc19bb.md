## Executive Summary
- On January 23, 2025, 33-year-old ice climber Eugene (Yevhen/Zhenya) Vahin sustained a fatal unroped fall at The Junkyards near Grassi Lakes in Canmore, Alberta, Canada. 
- RCMP and Kananaskis Mountain Rescue responded to an overdue-climber report; KMR located Vahin deceased and completed a ground recovery to RCMP later that evening.
- The exact circumstances and fall distance were not determined. Outcome: 1 fatality; no additional injuries or rescues reported.

## Location and Context
- Peak/Area: The Junkyards (also known as Junkyards), near Grassi Lakes
- Region: Canmore, Bow Valley, Alberta, Canada
- Activity/Style: Ice climbing; unroped

## Timeline of Events
| Approx. Time/Date | Event |
| --- | --- |
| Jan 23, 2025 (~unknown time) | Missed check-in leads to an overdue-climber report. |
| Jan 23, 2025 | RCMP requests assistance from Kananaskis Mountain Rescue. |
| Jan 23, 2025 | Kananaskis Mountain Rescue deploys to The Junkyards near Grassi Lakes. |
| Jan 23, 2025 | Subject (Eugene Vahin) located deceased at The Junkyards. |
| Jan 23, 2025 (Evening) | Ground recovery completed; remains transferred to RCMP. |

## Technical and Environmental Factors
- Anchor System: No rope in use; anchors/protection not reported.
- Group Exposure: One person involved; unclear if alone at the time of the fall.
- Terrain: Ice climbing terrain at The Junkyards; reports indicate he was likely near the top when he slipped; fall distance unknown.
- Environmental Conditions: Not reported.
- Avalanche Indicators: Not reported.
- Media/Device Context: The fall was reportedly not captured on his camera.

## Causal Analysis
### Proximate Cause
- Undetermined. Reports suggest an unroped slip near the top of a route, but the exact cause and fall distance were not established.

### Failure Modes
- Uncontrolled fall while unroped on ice terrain.
- No evidence of equipment or anchor failure; protection use not reported.

### Contributing Factors
- Technical: Absence of fall protection at the time of the incident (unroped).
- Environmental: Specific ice and weather conditions unknown.
- Human (Individual): Adult climber (33); no further personal factors documented.
- Human (Team): Only one person involved; partner presence at time of fall is unclear. Activation occurred after a missed check-in.

### Decision Review
- The incident occurred during unroped ice climbing, a mode with inherently high consequence for slips. Without details on the exact movement, terrain feature, or decision points, the transition “near the top” may have coincided with exposure where a slip became unrecoverable.
- The response sequence began after a missed check-in. While this facilitated recovery, it offers limited insight into on-site decisions or opportunities for immediate intervention.
- Absent information on equipment, partner status, or conditions, further evaluation of decision quality and timing is not possible.

## Counterfactual Scenarios (Preventability)
| Topic | Original State | Alternative | Avoidability | Expected Effect | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fall protection | Unroped on ice terrain | Use of rope with belay or top-rope | Possibly, if partner/anchor/equipment available | Could reduce likelihood of ground fall from a slip | Low–Moderate |
| Partner presence | One person involved; partner presence at fall time unclear | Partner present on-site to belay/monitor | Unknown | Faster activation and potential on-scene aid; survival impact unknown | Low |
| Head protection | Helmet use not reported | Helmet worn | Generally feasible | May mitigate severity of head trauma | Low |

## Uncertainties and Gaps
- Exact fall distance and trajectory are unknown.
- Precise location on the route (including pitch or feature) is unconfirmed; “likely near the top” is reported but not verified.
- Time-of-day for the fall, discovery, and activation milestones is not provided beyond “later that evening” for recovery.
- Presence and role of any partner at the time of the fall are unclear.
- Equipment details (helmet, harness, tools, rope availability, anchors) are not reported.
- Weather and ice conditions at the time are not reported.
- No official RCMP or Kananaskis Mountain Rescue incident logs included.
- No medical examiner documentation beyond reported severe head injury and internal bleeding.
- No witness statements; camera did not capture the fall.

## Rescue and Outcome
- Responders: RCMP and Kananaskis Mountain Rescue.
- Actions: Following an overdue report, KMR deployed, located the climber deceased, and completed a ground carry-out. A KMR representative stated that four staff responded and transferred the remains to RCMP.
- Outcome: One fatality; no additional injuries or rescues reported. No impediments or technical rescue systems beyond ground recovery were detailed.

## Lessons Learned
- Unroped movement on ice carries very high consequence; consider employing a rope and protection wherever a slip could be catastrophic.
- Treat “top-out” and transition zones with heightened caution; slips near the top can still be fatal.
- Establish clear check-in plans with defined timelines and escalation procedures when climbing without direct partner oversight.
- Where feasible, use head protection; head trauma was cited in this incident.
- When climbing alone or unroped, pre-plan conservative limits and exit strategies to avoid committing terrain without fall protection.
